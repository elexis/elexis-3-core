h1. Elexis SDK

__MEDEVIT <office@medevit.at>__ Last update: 21.01.2016

This project is used to automatically set-up an Elexis 3 development environment using the "Eclipse Oomph Installer":http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer. It integrates both core, base and "Medelexis":http://www.medelexis.ch  resources. This project is not used outside of the Oomph installer tool.

This documentation was verified with Oomph v1.3.0 Build 2066. The setup file referenced in this document is located in the root of this git repository (that is @../Elexis.setup@ )

h2. Usage

Eclipse Oomph is a toolkit to realize automated installations of project specific Eclipse installations. It is hence used to set-up Eclipse for a specific project. In order to employ Oomph to setup an Elexis development environment we proceed as follows:

# Download Oomph specific to your system from "https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer":https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer 
# Start Oomph (eclipse installer) and switch to the __Advanced__  wizard  <br> !images/switchToAdvanced.png! 
# In the advanced wizard select __Eclipse for RCP and RAP developers__ as @Product@   and select **Next>** 
# Now you see the list of @Projects@, here you have to add the setup file for Elexis. Save the link "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/master/Elexis.setup":https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/master/Elexis.setup . e.g as /tmp/Elexis.setup. Add it as follows <br> !images/addElexisUrlToOomph.png!
With OOMP 1.3.0 the https-URL did not work and you must add the Elexis.setup via the File system.
# Now you add the required Elexis parts to your installation setup. There exist four different parts
## @Elexis@ ( "elexis-3-core":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/ and "elexis-3-base":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-base/ ) - contains the base open source elexis, a github account is required
## @Medelexis@  - the Medelexis plugins part, only accessible to users who have access to the Medelexis repo
## @Medelexis Application@  - the core Medelexis application, only accessible to core Medelexis developers
## @Austria@ ( "elexis-3-austria":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-austria ) - setup for plugins specific to Austrian requirements , requires github account
# for a default open source development environment in the master stream select the projects as follows <br> !images/selectProjects.png! and press **Next>**. 
# the first time you use the installer you have to provide some additional information. Select "Show all variables" and please be careful to select the correct github username and/or access type, otherwise the installationw will fail. <br> !images/oomphConfiguration.png!
# You have to select the installation folder name, use @elexis@ or whatever fits you. Here you will finally find your pre-configured development environment for Elexis open source.
# Pressing **Next>** again you can verify the tasks being executed !images/oomphTasks.png! and start the installation with **Finish**. This will take a while.
# After the basic product installation was done, the newly installed Eclipse IDE is started and the setup tasks are executed (source checkout, IDE configuration etc.).
# If you some of your variables were wrong (e.g. wrong path for a Java JDK). The setup will not complete and you must correct the choices, via "Help..Performe Setup Tasks". There press **Back>** to be able to review the variables.
# Open ch.elexis.target/juno-target.target, wait for "Resolving Target Definition" to finish, then pressing **Set as Target Platform**
# Rebuild everything via the menu Project..Clean
# Open the menu "Run..Debug Configuration" and select in the left selection pane the "Eclipse application/ElexisCore_RunFromScratch" item. !images/debug_configuration.png! 
# Press Debug to launch a very minimal Elexis.

h2. Troubleshooting

We have seen cases where parts of the setup could not be installed. I might help if you
* Fork the elexis-3-core and elexis-3-base projects in github before running the OOMP installer, or you will experience problems with the checkout
* remove the BundlePool. Its name is shown near the bottom of the first screen after switching to the Advanced mode.
* restart the installation.

If the problem persists, open a bug report or send a mail to elexis "developer mailing list":elexis-develop@lists.sourceforge.net

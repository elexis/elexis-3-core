h1. Elexis 3 Core Repository

*IMPORTANT* Please employ the @3lexisFormatterProfile.xml@ as Eclipse default formatter prior to development and pull requests.
This accounts for all Elexis 3 related development.

h2. Install latest build

Go to "Jenkins-CI Builds":https://srv.elexis.info/jenkins/view/3.0/job/Elexis-3.0-Core/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/ch.elexis.core.p2site/target/products/. Download and unzip the zip file for your machine.

Install Oracle java 1.8 from "http://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp":http://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp

Start the Elexis3 application.


h2. Building

You need Java 1.8+. Maven 3.0.x (Higher version do NOT work due to plugin incompatibilities). Then you should be able to generate the application and p2 update site using the following calls:

@git clone https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core@
@mvn clean install@

It will be built for your OS/Window-System/Architecture combination. You will find the executables under @ch.elexis.core.p2site/target/products/ch.elexis.core.application.ElexisApp/*/*/*@ 

Note: This will fail in MacOSX. Build instructions for Mac:

@Install Homebrew@
@brew install homebrew/versions/maven30@
@git clone https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core@
@mvn clean install -Pall-archs -Dmaven.test.skip=true@



If you want a complete development environment, try "Oomph":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/tree/master/ch.elexis.sdk

h3. Generate Javadoc

Elexis uses Javadoc go documents its API interface. The Eclipse IDE offers built-in support for reading the javadoc for a given method or class and provides also helper to generate it.

This is accomplished by calling @mvn -DforceContextQualifier=javadoc javadoc:javadoc@. It generates a complete javadoc. The generated output can be search at "target/site/apidocs/index.html":target/site/apidocs/index.html. 

Even when theses javadoc are not used often, they provide a convenient way to get an overview over methods, packages, etc.

h3. Check whether Javadocs are correctly generated

We use checkstyle to generate Javadoc. Use the following command line:

@mvn checkstyle:checkstyle-aggregate site:site@

This generates an browsable HTML file "target/site/index.html":target/site/index.html. The links to the modules do not work, unless you call afterwards @ch.elexis.core.releng/cleanup_after_checkstyle.rb@, a small ruby script which generates a few missing links (not supported on Windows).

It uses the rules defined in @ch.elexis.core.releng/checkstyle.xml@ to generate warnings for missing Javadoc. For each project, there exists an error report. E.g "target/site/ch.rgw.utility/checkstyle.html":./target/site/ch.rgw.utility/checkstyle.html. An aggregated, overall statistics can be found under "target/site/checkstyle-aggregate.html":target/site/checkstyle-aggregate.html

If you want to add even more checks, look at ch.elexis.core.releng/checkstyle_full.xml. Adding new checks should be discussed on the developers mailing list.

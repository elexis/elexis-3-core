h2. Running the unittests

You need to grant access to the mysql and postgresql databases unittest.

For postgres run the following commands

bq.  sudo -u postgres psql -c "create database unittests"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "create user elexis with UNENCRYPTED password 'elexisTest';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "grant all privileges  on database unittests to elexis;"


For mysql run the following commands

bq. mysql --host=localhost --user root --password
create database unittests; 
grant all on unittests.* to elexis@localhost identified by 'elexisTest'; 

The Test_Patient.java contains tests which are run for H2, PostgreSQL and MySQL. As it is quite time consuming to setup a new database, this should be done only where really necessary.

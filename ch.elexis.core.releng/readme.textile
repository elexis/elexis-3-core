h1. elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng

This project contains utilities needed for the release engineering for elexis-3.

h2. Usage

* Very minimal at the time being

h2. Requirements

* Java 7
* Maven 3
* Eclipse Juno (3.8.2)
* Ruby/Rake/Jubula

h2. headless build (aka command line)

* @export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java-oracle/jdk1.7.0_25@ # Set your Java home
* @cd ch.elexis.core.releng/elexis.3rdparty.libraries && mvn clean p2:site@ # Builds a p2-site needed to use Eclipse target definition ch.elexis.core.releng/juno/juno.target
* @cd ../../ch.elexis.core.releng && mvn clean install@ # compiles and create packages

This creates directories like @ch.elexis.core.releng/product/target/products/ch.elexis.core.application.product/linux/gtk/x86_64@ where you find the executable @Elexis 3.0@ application.

The directory @ch.elexis.core.releng/product/target/repository/@ contains a simple P2 update-site for Elexis.

To deploy this site have a look at the excellent "Eclipse Tycho - Tutorial for building Eclipse Plugins and RCP applications":http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipseTycho/article.html#deploy. Or https://github.com/intalio/tycho-p2-scripts/wiki

* it is possible to compile a single project, which can be a lot faster, especially if you are working offline. E.g @cd ch.rgw.utility && mvn clean compile --offline@ takes only about 10 seconds here.

h3. Creating builds with a specific version

We used tycho-versions-plugin to ensure that all jar files of the built products (when built using with a Maven -SNAPSHOT, aka Eclipse qualifier version inside the pom.xml/MANIFEST.MF) look like @ch.rgw.utility_3.0.0.v20130725-1957.jar@. The timestamp corresponds to the last committed change inside the project.

* Update all projects to a new version.
Can be done easily using @./prepare_release.rb .. --version 3.0.0.qualifier@
* Building Beta/Release versions
If you want to build a specify a context to the version of the jar files in the build products with DforceContextQualifier=beta. In the individual project the jar file would 
still have the usual name e.g. ch.rgw.utility-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar. Details are found "here":http://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-packaging-plugin/build-qualifier-mojo.html
Using -DforceContextQualifier=beta1 and you target jar files will be named like
# ch.rgw.utility_3.0.0.beta1.jar
# ch.elexis.core_3.0.0.beta1.jar
Using -DforceContextQualifier=beta and you target jar files will be named like
# ch.rgw.utility_3.0.0.jar
# ch.elexis.core_3.0.0.jar


h2. problems

* We see quite often the error @Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-p2-publisher-plugin:0.18.0:publish-products (default-publish-products) on project ch.elexis.core.releng.product: Unable to locate the equinox launcher feature (aka delta-pack)@. It seems that a server (don't know which one) is quite often offline. In this case just call @mvn clean install --offline@ and the build will succeed, if you don't need to download any new dependency.
* How to keep MANIFEST.MF and pom.xml in sync. A "bug report":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=387802 recommends running @mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:update-pom -Dtycho.mode=maven && mvn clean install@

h2. Eclipse IDE

* build the project foreign-libraries
* open ch.elexis.core.releng/juno/juno.target and click on "Set as Target Platform"
* build your plug-ins

h2. TODO

* Fix problem with missing icons
* Create a tag (but with a good name not @jenkins-Elexis-3.0-Core-18@ and pushing it to github each time, all tests (JUnit, PDE-Test, Jubula) have passed on one/all architecture. The tag name should be something like @I_YEAR_MONTH_DAY_HOUR_MINUTE@, see example "eclipse.e4.tools":http://git.eclipse.org/c/e4/org.eclipse.e4.tools.git/

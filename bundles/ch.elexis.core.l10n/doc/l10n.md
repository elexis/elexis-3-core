# Localisation / translation

For a background see http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseInternationalization and consider that most Elexis plugins are still Eclipse 3 based.

## How to add a message

* Create a Messages.java if necessary
* Create in the new Messages.java a new constant (which will forward to the central Messages.java) by adding line like 

    static string Messages.MY_NEW_MESSAGE = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.MY_NEW_MESSAGE
    
* Create a first entry for it in ch.elexis.core.l10n/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages.properties
* Add more entries for each language either
** my manually editing  ch.elexis.core.l10n.[lang]/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages_[lang].properties
** or use the script ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb and call it 
*** ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-csv
*** ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --add-missing=[lang[
*** ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-properties

* It is the release managers duty to call the last three lines before publishing a new release to ensure that we have uptodate translation
* We strive to have a person responsible for each language to correct the google translation and ensure a high quality
* We use bundles/ch.elexis.core.l10n/doc/concepts.csv to document how we translate concepts which are used in elexis

## Why we place everything into one file

* When starting up we see clearly which messages or used or missing.
* Using constants in Messages.java make searching for occurrences much easier
* It is easier to detect/correct spelling differences/replacing one word by another

## Task list for Elexis 3.4 -> 3.5 french translation

### Howto migrate a single Messages.java which extends NLS

* Add a dependency (if needed) to ch.elexis.core.l10n in the MANIFEST.MF
* Check the feature.xml to ensure that ch.elexis.core.l10n gets included, too
* Edit the Messages.java file
	* change the to to look like
	   package ch.elexis.core.ui;
	    public class Messages  {
	    };	
	* copy all String xy = ; to ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.java
	* Remove line containing "BUNDLE_NAME"
	* replace all strings "String (.*);" using a regular expression with "String \1 = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.\1;"
* Remove the message*.properties files

### Before committing the changes

* Sort the string constants in ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.java

### Howto migrate a single Messages.java using  java.util.ResourceBundle

* Add a dependency (if needed) to ch.elexis.core.l10n in the MANIFEST.MF
* Check the feature.xml to ensure that ch.elexis.core.l10n gets included, too
* Replace the Messages.java with an empty declaration like

	   package ch.rgw.utility;
	    public class Messages  {
	    };	
 
* Build the project 
* For each failing replace (using regular expression `Messages.getString\("(.*)\.(.*)"\)`  by `Messages.\1_\2`
* Using Eclipse IDE add  each non declared constant to Messages.java
* Remove `= null` and `final` in the Message.java
* continue as with described in point "Howto migrate a single Messages.java which extends NLS"

### The individual tasks

* *Done:* Use the ruby `script ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb` to populate missing french/italian translations via google translations
* *Done:* Convert the 37 (of 162 Messages.java file elexis (core, base,gpl)) which have still the old format to the new format, eg.
  ch.elexis.core.data.util/Messages.java which extend org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS or import java.util.ResourceBundle
* *Done:* Wait till elexis-3-core/base are converted to the pomless tycho build (as this will move all java files into another subdirectory)
* *Done:* for each Messages.java we redirect all constants to ch.elexis.core.l10n
* The archie plugin has to be treated manually, as the translation is handled somehow differently
* the repository elexis-gpl will only be touched AFTER we merge Joerg sigles changes into 3.5
* Translations which are done via plugin*.properties and similar files, are done manually
* Verify manually the translation
	* If possible use the Jubula GUI tests and examine all generated screenshots
	* Create a dictionary with important translations for common concepts and place it into the elexis-3-core
* We decided to bundle all languages and properties into a single plugin	
* *Done:* Modified EigenartikelTyp, ICondition, etc which call directly ResourceBundle.getBundle("ch.elexis.core.findings.messages") like this
	* ResourceBundle.getBundle(ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.BUNDLE_NAME)
	* Join `getSimpleName()` and `this.name()` with `'_'` and not `'.'`

## Howto edit a single message

Use always the EclipseResourceBundle (RBE) Editor. It allows you to modify all languages in a single view and neatly sorts each properties files alphabetically.

## Watch for missing/superfluos definitions

* Missing/superfluos translations are flagged when starting the application/loading a plugin, watch them
* Moving/Changing the Messages.java creates problems when merging changes from one branch to another

# Working with the translations.csv

The concerned files are:
    * Messages.java and messages*.properties which are the old source
    * $HOME/google_translation_cache.csv # caches google translations. Copy and install it between developers
    * $PWD/translations.csv translations for the current project. Missing translations can be added here,
      but the value here are overridden from the properties file, when you call i18n_gen_info.rb with the --to-csv option

The workflow was the following

* Install the needed gems (must only be done once. Requires a running ruby version >= 2.0

	cd /path/to/elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng
	gem install bundler
	bundle install

* Go to the desired directory, which is problably a checkout of elexis-3-core or elexis-3-base

	 cd /path/to/elexis-3-base

* Parse all the Messages.java and import them into a translations.csv file in the curren working directory

     /path/to/elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-csv bundles/ # will creates a translations.csv

* Add missing translations, must be called for each language, eg, fr or it.

	* Note: To be able to use the google translation, the environment variable TRANSLATE_API_KEY must be defined

	  /path/to/elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --add-missing translations.csv
      <...>
      Saving 7442 entries to /home/niklaus/google_translation_cache.yaml
      
* edit manually missing/incorrect translations in translations.csv

* To create new plugin*properties

      /path/to/elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-plugin-properties bundles # or bundles/my.bundle

* To create new messages*properties

      /path/to/elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-messages-properties bundles
      
* Check your results, compare the diff with the HEAD, for the plugins*properties I use often some git options, as I found no way to create compatible RBE plugin*.properties

      git diff -w --ignore-blank-lines bundles/*/plugin*

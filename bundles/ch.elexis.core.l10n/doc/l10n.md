To ease the development pain, we decided in April 2022 to place all translations
into a single plugin bundles/ch.elexis.core.l10n to be shared with all open
source and proprietary plugins.

# NOT YET: Migrate to e4 messages

As many components of Elexis are still Eclipse-3 based we cannot use injection
to translate messages. Also we cannot migrate to use
org.eclipse.e4.core.services.nls instead of extending org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS.
E.g. There are some really static string in ch.rgw.utility, eg. FileTool

## Analysing the translations

Using a SQL database is often much faster than browsing a CSV file via LibreOffice.
If you want to look via H2 at all the translations, it is easy to setup a
H2 database and import the translations.cvs. We assume, that you have somewehere
a com.h2database_<version>.jar, eg. in an Elexis installation.

To convert the l10n-messages.properties into a CSV use (in a git checkout)
`ch.elexis.core.releng/convert.rb --to-csv` it will finish with something like$
`Wrote 6238 entries to ./bundles/ch.elexis.core.l10n/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages.csv` .
Start it using `java -jar /path/to/elexis/plugins/com.h2database_1.4.200.jar  -url jdbc:h2:~/translations`
In the console window execute `create table translations as SELECT * FROM CSVREAD('translations.csv');`
S.a. https://www.h2database.com/html/tutorial.html

	drop view if exists  t_v; drop table if exists translations;
	create table translations as SELECT * FROM CSVREAD('bundles/ch.elexis.core.l10n/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages.csv')
	create view if not exists t_v as select key, substring(de, 0, 60) german, substring(en, 0, 60) english, substring(fr, 0, 60) french, substring(it, 0, 60) italian from translations;
	select * from t_v limit 5;
	select * from translations limit 5;
	select  substring(de, 0, 60) as german from translations limit 5;
	select key, substring(de, 0,60) german, substring(fr, 0, 60) french from translations limit 5;

	select tv_1.german,  tv_2.french from  t_v tv_1 join t_v tv_2 on  tv_1.german  = tv_2.german limit 5

select tv_1.german,  tv_2.french from  t_v as tv_1, join tv tv_2 as  tv_1.german  = tv_2.german group by tv_2.german, tv_2.french having count(  tv_2.french)  > 1

SELECT t.id, t.name, t.brand, t.price, s.quantity, s.date
FROM toys t
JOIN sales s
ON t.id = s.toy_id
WHERE s.date = '2020-07-03';


SQL-Databases are handy to give answers for questions like **Find my all duplicated german entries**.
This can be answered by entering `select count(de) anzahl, de from translations group by de  having anzahl > 1 order by anzahl desc;`
E.g, I found 32 definitions for the value "Fehler", aka error.
`select key, de from translations where de = 'Fehler';`

To find missing translations use something like `select key, fr from translations where de = ''`

Here a statement I use to compare the french translation compared to the the german origin
`select key, substring(de, 0,60) german, substring(fr, 0, 60) french from translations order by length(de), de`.
I order it by the length of the string, then by the string itself, as my hypothese
was that short string were sometimes translated differently. And indeed `AUF`
was translated once as `Certificat maladie` and once as `Cértificat médical`.

Finding entries where the german and french translations are the same can be
done via `select key, substring(de, 0,60) german, substring(fr, 0, 60) french`
`from translations where de = fr order by length(de) desc, de`. The longer the
german text is, the less probable is a corresponding matching french translation

Missing translations can be found via `select key, de from translations where de is null`.

## Why we place everything into one plugin with one file and thousands of variables

* When starting up we see clearly which messages or used or missing.
* Using constants in Messages.java make searching for occurrences much easier
* It is easier to detect/correct spelling differences/replacing one word by another
* We (the core developers of elexis) promise to add for anybody developing plugins
for eclipse to add the needed variables and translations in 
bundles/ch.elexis.core.l10n/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/Messages.java
even if the plugin is not open source.
* Translations in plugin.xml files must be handled by every plugin via plugin*.properties
* We are aware that we might hit a Java limit of max 64K constants
* The release manager should add an actual version of translations.cvs ch.elexis.core.l10n

## How to add a message

* Create a new Messages.java if you want in your plugin, if you wand to
  have a place where you find your messages easily
* Create in the new Messages.java a new constant (which will forward to the central Messages.java) by adding line like 

      static string Messages.MY_NEW_MESSAGE = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.MY_NEW_MESSAGE
    
* Create a first entry for it in ch.elexis.core.l10n/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages.properties
* Add more entries for each language either
** my manually editing  ch.elexis.core.l10n.[lang]/src/ch/elexis/core/l10n/messages_[lang].properties
** or use the script ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb and call it 
*** `ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-db */bundles`
*** `ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --add-missing`
*** `ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-properties */bundles`
*** `ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --emit-l10n`

* It is the release managers duty to call the last three lines before publishing a new release to ensure that we have uptodate translation
* We strive to have a person responsible for each language to correct the google translation and ensure a high quality
  * Buying was cheap: see https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing
* We use bundles/ch.elexis.core.l10n/doc/concepts.csv to document how we translate concepts which are used in elexis

### Howto migrate a single Messages.java which extends NLS

* Add a dependency (if needed) to ch.elexis.core.l10n in the MANIFEST.MF
* Check the feature.xml to ensure that ch.elexis.core.l10n gets included, too
* Edit the Messages.java file
  * Change import org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS to org.eclipse.e4.core.services.nls.Message
  * remove the static from all String declarations
	* change the to to look like
	   package ch.elexis.core.ui;
	    import org.eclipse.e4.core.services.nls.Message;
	    public class Messages  {
	    }
	* copy all String xy = ; to ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.java
	* Remove static initialize containing "BUNDLE_NAME"
	* remove private Message(){}
	* replace all strings "String (.*);" using a regular expression with "String \1 = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages.\1;"
* Remove the message*.properties files

### Howto migrate a single Messages.java using java.util.ResourceBundle

* Check the feature.xml to ensure that ch.elexis.core.l10n gets included, too
* Replace the Messages.java to look like like

       package ch.elexis.example;

       public class Messages  {
            public static String myId = ch.elexis.core.l10n.Message.myId;
       };
 
* You may use the regular expression `Messages.getString\("(.*)\.(.*)"\)`  by `Messages.\1_\2`
* Build the project 
* Remove `= null` and `final` in the Message.java

## Howto edit a single message

Use always the EclipseResourceBundle (RBE) Editor. It allows you to modify all languages in a single view and neatly sorts each properties files alphabetically. Be aware that the RBE has a very special formatting.
Also watch for multi-line entries like in ResponseAnalyzer_MoreInformationsRequested

## Watch for missing/superfluos definitions

* Missing/superfluos translations are flagged when starting the application/loading a plugin, watch them
* Moving/Changing the Messages.java creates problems when merging changes from one branch to another

# Working with the translations.csv

Niklaus uses also [https://www.deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com).

The concerned files are:
    * Messages.java and messages*.properties which are the old source
    * $HOME/google_translation_cache.csv # caches google translations. Copy and install it between developers
    * $PWD/translations.csv translations for the current project. Missing translations can be added here,
      but the value here are overridden from the properties file, when you call i18n_gen_info.rb with the --to-db option

The workflow was the following

* Have ruby version >= 2.0

* Go to the desired directory, which is problably a checkout of elexis-3-core or elexis-3-base
* The ruby script elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb creates a
SQLite3 database to simplify manual fixes. The sqlitebrowser can be used
as an alternative to the h2-db
* Go to the desired directory, which was a checkout of elexis-3-core, elexis-3-base, elexis-gpl, medelexis-3-application and medelexis-3

      cd /path/to/
      rm translations* ~/~/google_translation_cache.csv # to start with a clean
      # ensure that all repositories are in a clean state
      export TRANSLATE_API_KEY=<secretvalue> # to be able to use the google API

* Parse all the Messages.java, messages*.properties and plugin*.properties
  and import them into a translations.csv file in the curren working directory

      elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-db  */bundles
      # create translations.yaml

* Parse all plugin*.properties and add them to translations.yaml

      elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-plugin-properties  */bundles

* Add missing translations

      ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --add-missing
    
* edit manually missing/incorrect translations in translations.csv

* To create new plugin*properties

      elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-plugin-properties bundles # or bundles/my.bundle

* To create new messages*properties

      elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --to-messages-properties bundles

* To eliminate messages constant with duplicate entries
  you should run this on the elexis-3-core repository only after having it run on the dependent repositories (elexis-3-base, medelexis-3-application, medelexis-3)

      `ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --eliminate bundles`


### Howto externalize a bundle

* Bundle must have set Bundle-Localization: plugin [see](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse4/RCP/Modeled_UI/Localization)

* Localize plugin.xml and fragment.e4xmi

  In the plugin.xml and all `*.e4xmi` files replace all non-translated (which do not start with a `%`) elements with
  and identifier preceded by `%`, eg.  eg. `name="Iatrix Hilfe"` > `name="%iatrix_help"`.
  Create a plugin.properties if necessary and add (using the Resource Builder Editor in the Eclipse IDE) for each
  of the new identifier a translation, which will show up as a line like `iatrix_help = Iatrix Hilfe` in the plugin.properties.

* Run  `elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --standardize path/to/bundle`

  This replace some common values like ' ', '' by constants from org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils in all java file
  under the given path.

* See https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-wizard-externalize-strings.htm

  * Configure the Accessor class to ch.elexis.core.l10n.Messages

  *  Ignored
	  Marks the selected strings to be ignored from externalization. These strings will be marked with a '//$NON_NLS' comment and the compiler will ignore this string when warning about non-externalized strings.

  *  Externalize
	  Marks the selected strings to be externalized. Externalized strings will be placed in a property file and the code will be changed to a lookup to the property file.

  * Use of {} to bind variables
	  e.g define in properties/Messages.java `key_two = This is an {0} of binding with one argument.`
	  and use it like `message = NLS.bind(Messages.key_two, "example usage"); //$NON-NLS-1$`

* Check whether the defined messages already exist in the l10n/Messages. You may use

	  `elexis-3-core/ch.elexis.core.releng/i18n_gen_info.rb --analyze-new  path/to/bundle`
	  If you have duplicate, I suggest to refactor the concerned message to use an existing one

# History/Todo of individual tasks

* *Done:* Convert the 37 (of 162 Messages.java file elexis (core, base,gpl)) which have still the old format to the new format, eg.
  ch.elexis.core.data.util/Messages.java which extend org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS or import java.util.ResourceBundle
* *Done:* Wait till elexis-3-core/base are converted to the pomless tycho build (as this will move all java files into another subdirectory)
* *Done:* for each Messages.java we redirect all constants to ch.elexis.core.l10n

h1. Contacts documentation

This contacts plug-in consists of three views, which together cover all aspects of contact and patient management.

h2. Contact selector view

h3. The intelligent text filter field

The search field is not case sensitive, so for example @Markus@ and @markus@ are treated accordingly.

|_. Input Type |_. Result  |_. Example |
| @#@ number | Only the contact with number @number@ is shown | @#1@ -> Marco Descher|
| part of name | All contacts containing this part of a name are shown. | @mar@ -> Marco Descher, Markus Maier |
| part of name, part of name, ... | All contacts with one of the parts are shown | pic |
| @=@ formula @;@| A formula is directly evaluated and presented | @=13+4;@ -> 13+4=17|

The keybinding to call intelligent search is @M1+1@

h3. Define relationships between contacts

Simply drag on contact on to the other contact. The order is simple, if you drag contact A onto contact B and the define the relation it is like you have Person A pointing at Person B saying "this guy is my friend". The result will be that for now on A has a relation mark @friend@ to B entered in his file.

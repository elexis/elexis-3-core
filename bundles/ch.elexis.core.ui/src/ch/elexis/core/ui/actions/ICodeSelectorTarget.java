 * An ICodeSelectorTarget can receive objects from CodeSelector lists when they
 * are selected. GlobalEvents allows to register exactly one ICodeSelectorTarget
 * at a time. This one receives the selected target.
 *
 * A ICodeSelectorTarget should register itself to GlobalEvents and then
 * activate the appropriate view for code selection. It should unregister itself
 * as soon as possible. Since the code selection itself is an asynchronous
 * process, it's difficult to say which is the right place for this. A good idea
 * would be when the view is hidden and when the view gets the focus.

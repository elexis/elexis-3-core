h1. Elexis Console Application

**Initial implementation by**  "MEDEVIT":www.medevit.at

This application runs a bare Elexis on the console. It demonstrates the headless running
capabilities of @ch.elexis.core.data@. This allows to access an Elexis database without
starting a full graphical system.

 In order to use this plugin as unit test starting point for the core, please add your 
 testing code to @ch.elexis.core.console.application.test@.
 
 To start the application right click on @ConsoleWithCoreDataOnly.launch@ and 
 select @Run As@.
